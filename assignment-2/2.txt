char *line = nullptr;   // eller char *line = 0;
strcpy(line, "Dette er en tekst");

First a character pointer is created, pointing to the null pointer (or address 0x0)
Then, there is a an attempted call to strcpy. If done correctly, this would make the
"line" pointer point to the supplied string.
However, "line" does not point to a valid memory location, nor does it have sufficient
space for the supplied string.

Therefore, the above code would result in an invalid memory access operation and crash.
